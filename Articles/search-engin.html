<h3>What happened when you Press Search engine Like www.google.com</h3>

<p>All it work using some processes that you will know in this <a href=#Article>Article</a></p>

<p>What they are and how they Work.</p>

<section id="#DNS">
 <h3> The Domain Name Server(DNS)</h3>

<p>A DNS is a method of Finding IP Address for a web or application, When you Enter Your Client Softwares to Search Somthing like <span>www.google.com</span> or <span>Wikipedia.org</span>,  it's DNS work to find what you want by transferring your request into the IP Address of the Website You are looking for in word wide web(www).</p>

<p>It's DNS work to recognize all the web or Application IP addresses that it will be difficult for Users to recognize,  after recognizing the Name that assigned to the IP address.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE :</strong><br>
If <span>8.8.8.8</span> IP = AmirKano.tech,<br>
When you type AmirKano or AmirKano.tech it's DNS work to take you to <span>8.8.8.8</span> IP Adress that represents AmirKano the Web you a Looking for,  and all this happens Using UDP(User Datagrams Protocol)  or TCP.</p> 
</section>

<section id="#TCP/IP">
<h3>The TCP/IP.</h3>

<p>A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP),  is a Communication suite protocol use to communicate internet and Devices.</p>

<p>The TCP works under some Layers protocol like, Data Link Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer and other more.</p>
</section>

<section id="#Firewall" >
<h3>The Firewall.</h3>

<p>A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies,
It's between Users client  and the internet.</p>

<p>A firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet works for the Safety of Users and the network provider monitoring system.</p>
</section>

<section id="#HTTPS/SSH">
  <h3>The HTTPS/SSH.</h3>

 <p>A Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS),  is a secured method by an SSL certificate, that show the Security of a web.  When a website have HTTPS it means that the web is secured and more safe for User,  and a lock key appear in the the top search of the web.</p>

<h5>Different Between HTTP and HTTPS.</h5> 

<p>A HTTPS is Encrypted the data accept from User using SSL or TLS protocol and the web code for security while the HTTP accept it without Encrypted.</p>

<p>The SSH is also a part of HTTPS protocol  that performs the encryption of the data.</p>
</section>

<section id="#Loading-Balancer">
<h3>The Loading Balancer</h3>

<p>A Loading Balancer is a software and hardware that stand between Users and Servers. A Loading Balancer accept all Users request in One time on a web or software and send it to to several servers that a sign to.</p>

<p>It's Loading Balancer work to allow all users get what they requested from server in from different locations and different requests all in one time.</p>
</section>

<section id="#Web_Server">
<h3>A Web Server</h3>
<p>A Web Server is a Softwares work between Local clients to internet to Router to loading Balancer and then Server connect using HTTPS or HTTP protocol.</p>

<p>On the hardware , A web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files like HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and other more.</p>

<p>A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.</p>
</section>

<section id="#Application_Server">
<h3>The Application Server</h3>

<p>An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system (DBMS), communications and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side.</p>
</section>

<section id="DB">
<h3>The Databases(DB)</h3>

<p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.</p>

<p>A Databases often store information about people, such as customers or users. For example, social media platforms use databases to store user information, such as names, email addresses and user behavior. The data is used to recommend content to users and improve the user experience.</p>

<p>All these methods are the methods Softwares and Website we use day to day work on,  it's with those methods all they are operating.</p>
